# This is a wrapper around simply calling appIntermediate.out, the final OCaml
# bytecode binary output of jengaboot. However, we can't directly call
# `./app.out`, because it'll be executed with the `ocamlrun` (the runtime),
# whose path is hard-coded inside the binary as
# `/Users/chenglou/.opam/4.02.3/bin/ocamlrun` (or whatever the current compiling
# person's `ocamlrun` is), which obviously fails on everyone else's computer. To
# solve that, we run the script through the user's own `ocamlrun`, by doing
# `ocamlrun ./app.out`, while assuming that `ocamlrun` is currently globally
# exposed on the user's machine (comes with the OCaml distribution).

# Find and execute app.out. This script might be symlinked, that's why.
