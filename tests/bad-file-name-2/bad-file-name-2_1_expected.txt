[33mWarning[0m 24: file name potentially invalid. The OCaml ecosystem's build systems usually turn file names into module names by simply upper-casing the first letter. In this case, `Bad-file-name-2_1.ml` contains `-`, which doesn't form a legal module name.
Note: some build systems might e.g. turn kebab-case into CamelCase module, which is why this isn't a hard error.
